# Kirby Partial Cache

*Version 0.1*

Partial cache made simple!

- [Installation instructions](docs/install.md)
- [Options](docs/options.md)

## Usage

The only thing you need to use is the `partial::cache($filename, $callback, $expire = null)` function.

- The first argument is the filename. By default it will be renamed to a hashed md5 filename.
- The second argument is a function callback. Inside it, place the slow code that you want to cache.
- The third argument is optional. It's an expire time that will override the default option.

Everything within the callback function will be cached. When it reaches the expire time, it will run again and recached.

### Basic

```php
echo partial::cache('filename.txt', function() {
    return 'Hello world!';
});
```

### Use arguments

```php
echo partial::cache('filename.txt', function() use ($page, $site) {
    return $page->title() . ' - ' . $site->title();
});
```

### Use a custom expire time

The third argument is the cache expire time, which is optional. In this case the cache will refresh after 1 minute (60 seconds).

```php
echo partial::cache('filename.txt', function() {
    return $page->title();
}, 60);
```
