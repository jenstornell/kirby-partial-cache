## Usage

### Cache pages

This cache will cache pages similar to the built in cache. The difference is that it will expire after a time of your choice. It's expecially good for sites that use a database where Kirby does not know when the content has been updated.

You need to add this to your config:

```php
c::set('time.cache.pages', true);
```

That's it! You pages should now be cached!

To see `id`, `filename` and `timestamp` in the cached HTML code, you can also add this option:

```php
c::set('time.cache.pages.comments', true);
```

*You can't add the last option after the page has already been cached. Then you need to remove the cache file or wait for the cache to expire and refresh itself.*

### Cache part - Basic

Use it in a template or a snippet like this:

```php
echo time::cache('filename.json', function() {
    return 'Hello world!';
});
```

### Cache part - Advanced

```php
$page = page('about');
$site = site();

echo time::cache('filename.json', function() use ($page, $site) {
    return $page->title() . ' - ' . $site->title();
}, 60);
```

**Use arguments**

It uses `$page` and `$site` that then become available inside the `time::cache` function. You can use any variables you want.

**Time expire**

It also has the third argument `60` which is the expire time. It will refresh the cache in 1 minute (60 seconds). You can also set the expire time globally with the `c::set('time.cache.expires')` [option](docs/options.md).
